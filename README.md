# CUNY Login Phishing Site Simulation

**CSCI 401 Capstone Experience in Digital Forensics/Cybersecurity II**

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a capstone project focused on simulating a phishing attack by replicating the CUNY login page. The project demonstrates how attackers could create a convincing fake website to deceive users and collect sensitive credentials.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to:
- **Replicate the CUNY login page** as accurately as possible to study phishing techniques.
- **Store submitted credentials locally** to analyze how such attacks could be carried out.
- Highlight the importance of cybersecurity awareness and secure authentication mechanisms.

This project was conducted for educational purposes only and adheres to strict ethical and academic guidelines.

## Features
- **Pixel-perfect replication** of the CUNY login page.
- Local data storage of submitted credentials for simulation purposes.
- Insights into common phishing techniques used by attackers.

## Technical Details
- The project does not interact with live systems or real data.
- All stored data is simulated and remains entirely local.
- Built as a controlled demonstration for academic purposes.

## How It Works
1. The replicated login page is served to users.
2. Users are prompted to enter their credentials (as they would on the real site).
3. Submitted data is stored locally for analysis.

## Disclaimer
This project was created solely for educational purposes to raise awareness about phishing attacks. It is intended to help students and professionals understand the importance of identifying phishing attempts and improving online security practices.
